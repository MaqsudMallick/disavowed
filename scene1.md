Evan von Drakos limped through the derelict orchard where iron-leafed elms rattled like coins in a beggar’s cup. Moonlight jagged across his breastplate, silvering the crusted blood that glued split mail to his ribs. Each step tore a new seam of pain, yet the greater ache was the silence—no banter from Deryn, no soft humming from Sister Sura. Six shadows had marched out beside him; only his stumbled footfalls returned.

A lone crow croaked from the hedge. Evan froze. Three beats—no answering call. The code for “safe.” He exhaled steam and pressed a trembling finger to the rune-lock on his signet. A pulse of violet etched the family dragon through the fog, dying fast. Contact made.

Minutes later, a cloaked figure emerged between the trunks, lantern hooded, gait impeccably measured. The stranger’s face was swaddled in gauze, but even wrapped, that aristocratic poise could belong only to Baron Godred von Drakos.

“Report,” the baron murmured, voice flattened of every familial vowel.

Evan tried a salute; his arm shook. “Objective compromised. Team Delta-Seven… neutralised. Assailants anticipated our route. Scry-ward nets, null-sigils, heavy quarrels. I—I was pinned under Commander Mairn. Her last order was…” His throat closed.

Godred scraped a circle in the frost with his boot, revealing black loam. “Stand inside the mark, Lieutenant.”

The circle thrummed as wards knitted overhead—an invisible dome. Secrets would not leak. Evan obeyed, boots smearing the edge.

“Describe the breach.”

Rain began—a whisper at first, then needles. Droplets stung his cuts, dragging memory with them: Mairn’s armor buckling, Sura’s spell sputtering crimson, Deryn’s laugh cut short. Words tumbled out, disjointed. He spoke of decoys that looked like refugees, of sigil-ink oxidising into gas, of a falcon standard glimpsed where no banner should have flown.

All the while Godred’s gloved thumb tapped the pommel of his cane, a metronome untroubled by horror.

Lightning forked, bleaching the orchard. In that flash Evan saw the baron’s eyes behind the ragged disguise—coal-calm, tallying.

“…and when I crawled free, Sergeant Bryn was already—” The sentence withered.

Silence pooled. Only rain drummed on helm and hood.

At length Godred spoke, crisp as a notary: “Do you know why your unit was chosen for this mission?”

“Because Delta-Seven were expendable,” Evan answered, bitterness acid on his tongue.

“Incorrect.” The baron flicked water from his cuff. “You were selected because we believed a mole nested among you.”

Evan’s pulse lurched. “A … mole? Sir, with respect, every oath-seal—”

“Fake.” Godred stepped closer. “The courier you chased? A phantom. The cipher you were told to retrieve? Fabricated. What was real was the pressure cooker—life-or-death stakes. A traitor deprived of handlers would improvise, tilt the odds for some external rescue.”

Wind keened through stripped branches. Evan tasted iron again—this time from his bitten lip. “You think I broke formation on purpose?”

“I think,” Godred said, “that only one operative emerged alive. A statistical improbability.”

Evan’s laugh fractured into coughs. “I survived because Mairn ordered me to carry intel!” He fumbled at his breast, producing a blood-smeared crystal shard. “Her last words—‘Run, lieutenant. Tell the baron.’ ”

Godred’s eyes flicked to the shard but he did not take it. “Loyalty is easily forged on a dying woman’s breath.”

The circle ward pulsed red—truth-spell engaged. Evan felt heat under his tongue, the sigil reacting. He could taste the magic, coppery, accusing.

“Evan von Drakos,” Godred intoned, “by authority of the Obsidian Concord I charge you with high treason and fratricide until such time as the shard is verified.”

His cane clicked; a fine blade whispered free. Lightning flashed again, and in it Evan saw himself reflected—muddy, bruised, wide-eyed, already a ghost.

“Brother,” he croaked.

“Step-brother,” Godred corrected, ice-sharp. “Kneel.”

The orchard seemed to tilt. Evan’s muscles locked between fight and surrender. Rainwater sheeted off his helm, blurring vision. Branches overhead looked like clawed verdicts.

Somewhere far away a memory stirred: two boys fencing beside the family pond, Godred correcting Evan’s stance with patient hands. Trust the blade; don’t trust hope.

Hope guttered now.

He sank to one knee, mud swallowing the scorch mark. The shard slid from his grasp and shattered. Violet sparks leapt—then died.

Godred raised the sword—
