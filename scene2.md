Godred’s blade hovered at Evan’s nape, its rain-slick edge keen enough to split the dark. A single tremor from the baron’s wrist would end the last thread binding Evan to the living world. Tunnel-vision narrowed the orchard into a pen-and-ink vignette—survivors of lethal stress often report this adrenal choke, a funnel that devours peripheral sight.

 In that cramped aperture, Evan saw only the steel, his half-brother’s impassive mask, and the mulch where he would fall.

He forced his pulse to mirror Godred’s stillness, matching breath for breath the baron’s measured draws. Observe the rhythm; step into the rhythm, the old Armizare instructors used to say when teaching close-play grapples under the Fiore dei Liberi treatise.

 For pickpockets—street or stage—the maxim was identical: synchronize with a mark until your heartbeat becomes their metronome.

Slowly, deliberately, Evan lowered his gaze. Tradition dictated a man genuflect on the left knee before a superior, signaling humility while keeping the sword-hand free.

 But he needed both hands visible, trembling, useless. The drama had to read as capitulation, not calculation.

“Brother… I beg you,” he croaked, voice raw enough to rasp blood. Distress was no counterfeit; the pain in his ribs sang a descant to every syllable. Yet anguish could be an asset. Street grifters ranked public displays of vulnerability among the easiest gateways to theft—the first level in certain magician’s taxonomies.

 People instinctively lean toward suffering; their focus telescopes on the wound, never noticing the knife-hand slipping under the purse string.

Godred answered with silence, the sort that pinches oxygen from the air. Rain tapped on steel. Evan shifted, preparing the fall. In his peripheral memory—since he possessed no literal periphery right now—flitted a lesson on passing steps from HEMA drill: slide the weight forward as though your hips were pouring wine, never letting the torso bob.

 If he lurched, Godred’s sword would read hesitancy as treason; if he flowed, the motion might pass for collapse.

Down… trust the blade—don’t trust hope, Godred had once murmured during drills. The recollection sliced deeper than steel.

Evan’s knees buckled. His battered cuirass rang dully against the wet loam as he slumped, palms splaying in mud fragrant with rotting fruit. This was no theatrical swoon; he allowed real weight to hammer joints, jarring the breath from his lungs. Across the gulf of a single heartbeat the sword point pursued, tracing a lethal arc toward his exposed neck.

That breath, punched free, became a sob—convincing texture for the mask he wore. He clawed forward, fingers gouging earth, dragging his ribs across bark shards until he reached the hem of Godred’s cloak. Then came the clutch: desperate, greedy, both arms weaving around Godred’s calves. In the taxonomy of physical misdirection, close-body intrusion constitutes “occlusion”—you block the observer’s view with a dramatic gesture so the covert hand may work unseen.

“Mercy!” Evan gasped. “I stand loyal to the Concord—to you—since the day we sparred at dawn beneath Mother’s balcony. Remember? Say you remember!” Memory, psychologists note, is a vulnerable conduit for manipulation—embed a shared past and the target revisits it, eyes inward, not outward.

Godred’s balance rocked half a fingerbreadth backward, weight shifting to his rear foot as if startled by the touch. That infinitesimal lean loosened the cloak’s line, and with it the heavy chain that ran under the mantle to the signet tucked near the heart. A noble signet: ovoid sard set in gold, face engraved with the Drakos dragon rampant, used since elder wars to seal edicts and military orders.

 Though the ring could summon vassals, tonight its runic core mattered more, each groove packed with ember-dust from the royal crypt—dust that fed the violet pulse of their private wards.

Evan’s left arm stayed in plain sight, knuckles whitening around Godred’s boot. But his right hand vanished into cloak folds, moving under cover of a convulsive shudder. Stage magicians would call this “the eclipse”: a large emotional gesture masks the smaller, vital one.

 Sweat—cold despite the rain—slicked his wrist; gloves long since lost, every fingertip was a tactile antenna. He mapped cloth layers: outer wool, silk lining, the ridge of sword baldric, cooler metal of belt clip, then—pulse quickening—the round contour of waxed-thread necklace suspending the signet.

Godred’s sword touched scalp, parted clumped hair. “Compose yourself,” he ordered, voice so toneless it rang like a bell struck in vacuum. “You soil my boots with theatrics.”

Precisely the cue Evan needed. He amplified his trembling into a full-bodied sob, forehead pressing against the polished leather. His fingers pinched twin strands of necklace from either side of the ring—never pull the ring directly; tension transfers. Instead, you break the cord’s tension near the clasp. Evan twisted, friction-heating the thread; moisture helped, rain lubricating the fibers until, with a whisper softer than the orchard rain, the necklace parted.

He timed the break to coincide with a hiccupped wail. The phenomenon is codified among pickpockets as “beat synchronization”: align the snap with an auditory spike so the ear fails to flag it.

 The ring settled into his palm—heavy, warm with baronial body heat.

At once the kneeling posture threatened to betray him; muscles bunched, ready to vault. Patience. He had rehearsed this in corridors of his own dread: obtain, conceal, then disengage. His thumb pressed the signet into the shelf between wrist-bones, an anatomical hideaway robbers term the “life-line,” where a coin or ring may rest flat, invisible while hands appear empty.

Godred, sensing some rippled wrongness, drove his boot into Evan’s sternum. The kick exploded stars across Evan’s sight; copper flooded his mouth. He let the momentum roll him onto his side, arms flailing in apparent agony while, in truth, the signet slid up his sleeve. Mud coated the gold, muting its gleam.

The blade descended, nicking cloth at his shoulder. “Enough whimpering,” Godred hissed. “If you be loyal, yield your life for the kingdom’s proof.” His gaze flicked down at last—checking for the emblem that should dangle against his own chest.

Moments stretch before panic crystallizes. Magicians call this latency “dead air,” the breathless silence after a dove fails to appear.

 Evan saw the widening of Godred’s pupils, the sharpened inhale. Recognition. At the speed of thought, Baron von Drakos realized two truths: the signet was gone, and within it lay control of the ward whose shimmering confines both shielded and trapped them.

There was no further mercy in Godred’s stance. He withdrew the boot and, in a single flowing gesture worthy of Fiore’s stretto plays, pivoted off the rear foot, blade coiling for a forward thrust.

 Steel hissed. Evan flopped, letting the sword bury itself in sodden earth where his chest had been.

Heart hammering, he scrambled on elbows, coughing filth. His left hand, kept free of treasure, pushed for distance while the right arm hugged close, protecting the ring’s outline. The orchard blurred: trunks, shadows, runnels of water carving trenches through fallen leaves. Pain gnawed his side, but adrenaline iced it.

Godred yanked the blade free, mud trailing like viscera. “Return it,” he commanded, stepping over Evan’s prone form. Each stride was surgical, feet landing inside the prints Evan’s knees had made—domineering spatial control taught in master-of-arms salons.

Evan spat blood. “Would you kill every brother to find one mole?” he muttered, playing for seconds. Fingers found the rune-stud on the signet’s underside, a tiny diamond of cold iron. He pressed.

Nothing happened—yet. The ring required a spoken key and unimpeded sightline to the dome’s anchor rune. Those he did not yet have. But he could feel the dormant thrum, like a heart within a heart.

Godred crouched, sword point brushing Evan’s chin. Rain spider-webbed from the crossguard. “You have stolen the sovereign’s authority. Betrayal requires demonstration. Give me back the seal; die with honor.”

Honor. The word tasted like rust. Evan shook, half-sobbing, half-laughing. “I… I only wanted to serve.”

A flicker passed behind Godred’s eyes—regret? contempt? He raised the blade—

Evan lurched up, as though to clutch at Godred’s sleeve again, but this time it was theater alone, a misdirection cueing the penultimate phase: create a collision path that forces the target’s guard high while your true escape route opens low.

 Godred recoiled from the grasping hands, sword sweeping across to parry a non-existent knife.

That micro-flinch released spatial pressure on Evan’s lower quadrant. He rolled under the slash, shoulder screaming as fresh wounds tore, but momentum carried him between Godred’s legs. Slick turf aided the slide; his cuirass scraped root and stone before he came upright behind a trunk still bearing one stubborn, shriveled apple.

Hand hidden inside breastplate, he reversed the signet so its face—dragon rampant—could “see” the dome’s heart-rune where violet circuits chased themselves in slow helices above. A code phrase burned on his tongue, ancestral and unuttered since coronation oaths: Drakos ignia suum. Flames of his House. The words would light the signal.

Godred spun, eyes wildfire beneath the hood. Sword in two hands now, he advanced, closing measure with passing steps that ate the ground. Platelets of mud spattered Evan’s cheeks. The distance shrank to a single heartbeat.

Drakos— Evan inhaled.

“Thief!” Godred’s shout cracked the sky.

—ignia suum.

The orchard seemed to inhale with him. In the ring’s core, ember-dust ignited, runes pouring violet light between his fingers. Godred’s expression slid from fury to dawning horror, pupils reflecting lilac crescents.

And Evan smiled—a small, broken thing—because the theft was complete. The next instant would belong to part 2: steel and spellfire.
